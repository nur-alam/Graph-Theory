Here is the one example of traversal but still one bridge left to visit.

# Graph Data Stucture

A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

# Types of graph

## Simple Graph

## Directed Graph

## Undirected Graph

## Handshaking Theorem

Total degree of a graph is equal to twice of the number of edges.
Total degree of a graph = 2E

$\sum deg(g)$ = 2E
